# Getting started

 `phaser` can be installed via `pip` or `conda` using the instructions found on the main page. To get started with reconstructions, download one of the sample datasets described here. Each sample dataset has an associated reconstruction plan file `plan.yaml`.

 To reconstruct, simply run
 ```sh
 $ phaser run path/to/plan.yaml
 ```
